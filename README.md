- LibreOffice for using the templates. Install it with `sudo apt install libreoffice`.

## How to use it

If you don't plan to use these templates all the time, simply open the given files with LibreOffice and start writing your next document. Otherwise copy them to `~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/template/` and set them as the default template in LibreOffice.
